# Google-oauth-jwt

Google-oauth-jwt implements the creation of the signed JWT for Google Service Accounts,
to make authorized calls to Google APIs from server to server. All details here:

Advice: be sure that the machine time is well synchronized to successfully make the access token request and get a Bearer token.

Improvements and bug reports are welcome!
